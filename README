Requires GNU ARM toolchain:
[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/downloads.html]

Backup your existing kernel from the FAT partition on the RasPi's SD card
Copy the 'kernel.img' file produced by the make script to the SD card.
Insert SD card into the Pi and boot it.

In main.s, the pattern can be changed by editing the 'bitpattern' 32-bit
integer constant.
